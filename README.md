# Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis 
This code analyzes air quality data for multiple cities in India from 2015 to 2020. It calculates the Air Quality Index (AQI) for each day based on the concentration of PM2.5 and PM10 particles in the air. The AQI values are then classified into different levels of air quality based on the national air quality standards in India. Finally, the code produces line plots to visualize the AQI trends over time for each city.

The code is written in R and uses the following packages:

tidyverse
scales
lubridate

The analysis covers the following cities:
Amaravati
Amritsar
Chandigarh
Delhi
Gurugram
Hyderabad
Kolkata
Patna
Visakhapatnam

The data is sourced from the National Air Quality Index (NAQI) website of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Government of India.

The code can be run for each city separately by changing the input data file path and city name in the code. The output includes a line plot of AQI trends over time and a summary of the AQI levels for the entire time period. The code can also be modified to analyze data for other cities or time periods.

All the data is cleaned and pre-prepared so that you can directly start with your work
Feel free to use and modify the code for your own purposes. If you use this code in your research or project, please cite the source.
